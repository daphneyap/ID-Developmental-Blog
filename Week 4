Responsive Images:
- auto-resize based on screen size
- better performance
- provide better design control depending on device
- by setting a relative unit, we make our images fluid and they will resize accordingly
- scale up and down, 
.responsive-img {
width: 100%;
height: auto;
}
- .responsive-img-max {
max-width: 100%
height: auto;
}
- the max-width property sets a maximum width for an element, which does not allow the width of that element to be larger than its max-width value (but it can be smaller)
- images to scale never larger than original size,
.responsive-img-max-fixed-width {
max-width: 100%;
width: 400px;
height: auto;
}
- for different resolutions, use srcset
img {
width: 400px;
}
<img
srcset="
https://picsum.photos/400/400.jpg,
https://picsum.photos/600/600 1.5x,
https://picsum.photos/800/800 2x"
src="https://picsum.photos/400/400.jpg"
alt="Elva dressed as a fairy"
/>
- to fit images to a box, auto fit to box
.responsive-img-cover{
background-image: url(...);
background-size: cover;
}
