CSS Recap:
- with descendant selectors, can go as many levels as you want (best to use at most 3)
- grouping selectors can use {}, class method, or comma
- CSS styles can be inherited from the parent elements
- specifity determines how browsers decide which CSS rule takes precedence
- cascade in CSS refers to how style rules are applied based on specifity & source order
- !important keyword overrides source order & specifity

Media Queries:
- used to modify the CSS of a site depending on qualities such as viewport size or device type
- @media, applies one or more CSS properties based on the result of a media query
- min-width, if the minimum width of the viewport is at least the specific width or wider, then the media query is true
- max-width, if the maximum width of the viewport is at no more than the specified width, or itâ€™s narrower then the media query is true
- media features are used to test a specific feature of the device

Positioning:
- CSS position property lets you alter the positioning scheme of a particular element
- relative position, moves elements around relative to where they would appear on the page
- absolute position, offset is relative to the entire browser window instead of the original position of the element
- fixed position, very similar to absolute except the coordinate system is relative to the entire browser window, fixed elements don't scroll with the 
rest of the page, commonly known as sticky elements
- z-index, lets you control the depth of elements on the page, negative z-index go further into the page, posititive z-index comes out of the page, works only on elements with a 
position property set to absolute, fixed, or relative

Flexbox:
- the flexbox container is the parent of the flex item
- children of the flexbox container can be laid out in horizontal or vertical easily and flex their size when the content grows or shrink accordingly
- can adapt to layout to suit content
